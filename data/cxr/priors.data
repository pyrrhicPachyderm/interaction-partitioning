#The response variable is per capita seed production. Some of the species involved could produce thousands of seeds, so we take 1000 as a reasonable guess at the growth rate.
#We set the standard deviation equal to the mean, and hence the variance equal to the square of this.
Normal 1000 1000000
#Normal(0,1) is a fairly standard competition coefficient prior.
Normal 0 1
#An inverse gamma distribution is nice for error variance.
#We will leave a shape of 1, and set scale such that the mode (the mean of an inverse gamma function is undefined for shape = 1) is equal to the variance of the growth rate prior.
#This gives scale = (shape + 1) * (growth rate prior variance) = 2 * (growth rate prior variance)
