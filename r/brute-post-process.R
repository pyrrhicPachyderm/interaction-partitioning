#A set of helper functions for post-processing the data from brute forcing.
#Does not read in any data; data must all be passed in by arguments.
#Data is assumed to be passed as produced by the C++ program, however, with column names preserved.
#Additionally, some of the functions rely on a vector of species names.
#These must be provided in the order that the C++ program indexed the species.
